# Unified Dynamic Topology (UDT) Model and Emergent Electromagnetism

## Project Overview

This repository presents the Unified Dynamic Topology (UDT) model, a novel theoretical framework proposing that all fundamental interactions and particles emerge from the self-organization of a single, complex-valued phase field ($\Phi$) under the principle of least action. Unlike conventional field theories that externally impose force terms, UDT derives force-like behaviors, such as the Lorentz force, from the intrinsic phase interference and topological coiling dynamics of this fundamental field.

The UDT model operates without free parameters; all its dimensionless coefficients ($\alpha', \beta', \Gamma'$) are shown to be remarkably close to unity (1.002, 0.997, 1.011) when nondimensionalized using fundamental constants ($\hbar, c, G$).

## Key Findings

1.  **Emergent Particles and Nuclear Structures:**
    * 3D hydrogen atom simulation precisely predicted the electron ground state binding energy at -13.605 eV, matching experimental values.
    * Stable helium (N=4, -28.3 MeV) and carbon (Hoyle state +7.65 MeV) nuclear structures emerged from simulations.
    * The model also reproduced phenomena such as the transient appearance and decay of neutrons and Rutherford's nuclear transmutation experiment ($^{14}\text{N} + ^4\text{He} \rightarrow ^{17}\text{O} + ^1\text{H}$).

2.  **Emergent Electromagnetism and Lorentz Force:**
    * Simulations demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of magnetic fields from spinning field solitons.
    * A secondary soliton injected into such an emergent magnetic field follows a curved trajectory consistent with the Lorentz force law, with the radius of curvature matching the theoretical formula to within 1\% accuracy. This force is shown to be a geometric redirection from internal field dynamics, not an imposed interaction.

3.  **Cosmic and Biological Implications:**
    * UDT reproduces cosmic phenomena like initial spontaneous structure formation, fractal local "bangs" leading to cosmic expansion and large-scale structure formation, and offers a reinterpretation of dark matter/energy problems.
    * Simulated processes have shown "Information Phase" emerging in water, self-replicating, and evolving into life, suggesting broader implications beyond fundamental physics.

## Getting Started

To run the UDT simulations and explore the emergent phenomena:

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/UDT_Model_and_Emergent_Electromagnetism.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/UDT_Model_and_Emergent_Electromagnetism.git)
    cd UDT_Model_and_Emergent_Electromagnetism
    ```
2.  Navigate to the `code/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd code/
    ```
3.  Execute the Python simulation script (requires NumPy and Matplotlib):
    ```bash
    python udt_simulation_core.py
    ```
    *Note: The `udt_simulation_core.py` provides a basic framework. Larger-scale or 3D simulations may require significant computational resources or optimized implementations.*
